# snowbot
A snow bot, of course.

Playing around with sending DMs with media and links, maybe third-party weather and snow api data. 

Basically a snowbox where I can experiment...

New twists:

* Baking in twitter gem. First needed for media uploads.
* Stubbing out third-party requests.
* Iterating on Account Activity API set-up and subscriptions.
* Supporting only ENV for configuration and ripping out loading from config.yaml files.
