CU INSTAAR;Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research;https://instaar.colorado.edu/;INSTAAR develops scientific knowledge of physical and biogeochemical environmental processes at local, regional and global scales, and applies this knowledge to improve society's awareness and understanding of natural and anthropogenic environmental change.
NSIDC;National Snow & Ice Data Center;https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/snow/science;The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) supports research into our world’s frozen realms: the snow, ice, glaciers, frozen ground, and climate interactions that make up Earth’s cryosphere. NSIDC manages and distributes scientific data, creates tools for data access, supports data users, performs scientific research, and educates the public about the cryosphere.
CSAS;Center For Snow & Avalanche Studies;https://snowstudies.org/;The Center for Snow & Avalanche Studies and our Senator Beck Basin Study Area serve the mountain science community and regional resource managers by hosting and conducting interdisciplinary research and sustaining integrative 24/7/365 monitoring that captures weather, snowpack, radiation, soils, plant communities and hydrologic signals of regional climate trends. Senator Beck Basin is also the home of the Colorado Dust-on-Snow Program. The slide show above illustrates some of the research teams we've hosted, and we invite additional researchers to utilize Senator Beck Basin facilities and data.
Sierra Snow Pack;CA Data Exchange Center;https://cdec.water.ca.gov/snow/current/snow/;The California Data Exchange Center (CDEC) installs, maintains, and operates an extensive hydrologic data collection network including automatic snow reporting gages for the Cooperative Snow Surveys Program and precipitation and river stage sensors for flood forecasting.
Central Sierra Snow Lab;UC Berkeley research field station;http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/research-unit/central-sierra-snow-lab;Located at Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada, the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory is a research field station of UC Berkeley specializing in snow physics, snow hydrology, meteorology, climatology, and instrument design. Built in 1946 by the (then) U.S. Weather Bureau and Army Corps of Engineers, it is administered by UC Berkeley's Vice Chancellor for Research.
NASA;Hydrological Sciences - Science Research Portal;https://neptune.gsfc.nasa.gov/hsb/index.php?section=369;Changes in snow quantity and snowmelt timing are underway and have serious consequences. However, the quantity of snow stored across the prairies and tundra, in the mountains, on sea ice, and in the forests remains difficult to measure, hindering efforts to understand how, why and where this precious resource is changing. Airborne and satellite remote sensing provides a means of measuring these changes in a consistent manner over large areas on a regular basis, but developing the optimal instruments to measure snow requires an investment of dollars and a long-term (several decades) effort. NASA seeks to measure global snow cover using multiple approaches including aircraft and field campaigns as well as through modeling and data assimilation, all derived from competitively-selected research activities.
Snowmelt Modeling;CU snowmelt modeling MS thesis;http://libraries.colorado.edu/record=b2684630~S3;University of Colorado library call#  T 1996 .M724 c.2 - Monitoring and modeling of snowmelt at Rocky Flats / by James Andrew Moffitt  -- Snowmelt modeling is based on energy and mass balances and the identification and quantification of the energy fluxes that influence snowmelt.
