# Snowbot

## Recent updates, things in motion, and future dreams

* Iterated 'generate content' class without much testing so far. Mainly code clean-up... like common JSON headers. 
* Going with all ENV configuration, and eliminating confile.yaml files. 
* Adding quick_rely DMs with photos.
* Added wrapper to twitter gem.

* TODO:
  * weather, current and forecast APIs
  * snow, resort reports
